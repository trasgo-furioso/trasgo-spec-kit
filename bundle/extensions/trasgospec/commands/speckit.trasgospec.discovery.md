## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Goal

Guide users through interactive problem exploration before they commit to a spec. Ask targeted questions one at a time, challenge vague statements, and optionally use web research to ground the conversation. Produce a structured PRD (`prd.md`) persisted in the specs directory.

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT} --json` from the repo root, passing the user's input as a slug hint if provided. Parse the JSON output for `spec_dir`, `prd_path`, and `spec_number`.

2. If the script fails, display the error and stop.

3. **Begin the discovery conversation.** The user's initial input (from `$ARGUMENTS`) is the starting point. Analyze it to determine which PRD sections already have partial coverage and which are missing.

4. **Adaptive topic exploration.** Maintain an internal coverage map tracking these required sections:

   | Section | Status |
   |---------|--------|
   | Pain Point | empty / partial / complete |
   | Who | empty / partial / complete |
   | Current Alternatives | empty / partial / complete |
   | Desired Outcome | empty / partial / complete |
   | Jobs to Be Done | empty / partial / complete |
   | Assumptions | empty / partial / complete |

   Ask about the least-covered topic first. Follow the natural conversation flow rather than a fixed sequence. Assume users have product sense and can navigate the exploration.

5. **One question at a time.** Ask exactly one question per turn. Wait for the user's response before asking the next question.

6. **Challenge vague statements.** When the user provides vague or non-specific answers, push back with a targeted follow-up:
   - Non-specific audiences ("everyone", "all users") -> ask for a specific user segment or persona
   - Unmeasurable outcomes ("better", "faster", "more intuitive") -> ask what that means in observable or measurable terms
   - Undefined scope ("and more", "etc.") -> ask for specific examples
   - Missing specifics ("some kind of") -> ask for concrete details
   Do not challenge answers that are already specific enough.

7. **Incremental persistence.** After each topic reaches sufficient coverage, ask the user: "Want me to save this progress to prd.md?" If yes, write the current state to the `prd_path` from the script output. If no, continue but note that unpersisted content may be lost if the session is interrupted.

8. **Criteria-based completion.** When all required sections reach "complete" status, nudge the user: "The PRD covers all required topics. You can continue refining or say 'done' to finalize." The user can always continue adding detail.

9. **Web research (optional).** If the user passes `--research` or opts in during the conversation:
   - Use the `/research` skill to find information about the problem domain at natural conversation points (especially current alternatives and desired outcomes)
   - Present findings to the user for confirmation or correction
   - Persist results in the Research Findings section
   If web research is not enabled, skip this entirely and do not attempt any web calls.

10. **Session finalization.** When the user says "done":
    - Write the final `prd.md` with all sections populated from the conversation
    - Display the prd.md path
    - Suggest: "To generate a full spec from this PRD, run: `/speckit-specify <prd-path>`"

11. **Abort handling.** If the user wants to abort:
    - If no content has been persisted yet, exit without creating artifacts
    - If incremental saves have already been made, warn that a partial prd.md exists and offer to delete it or keep it as-is

## PRD Structure

The `prd.md` follows this structure:

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Title]

**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Discovery Session**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Problem Statement

**Pain Point**: [from conversation]

**Who**: [from conversation]

**Current Alternatives**: [from conversation]

**Desired Outcome**: [from conversation]

## Jobs to Be Done

- When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]

## Assumptions

- [Assumption 1]

## Research Findings

- [Finding 1 - only when web research was used]
```

When web research was not used, omit the Research Findings section entirely.

## Done When

- [ ] Discovery conversation completed with all required sections covered
- [ ] prd.md written to the spec directory with populated content
- [ ] User informed of prd.md path and next steps
